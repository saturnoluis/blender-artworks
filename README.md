# My blender artworks

This repo contains the .blend files that I use to create some of the artwork that I publish on my instagram page: [@saturnoluis](https://instagram.com/saturnoluis)

The repo does not include the final rendered images since they are too heavy and would be a waste of resources, however it does includes the .blend files used to render them and any required assets.

I like to create series of three related pictures which I call "Collections", below are the previews of the collections, from newest (top) to oldest (bottom).
